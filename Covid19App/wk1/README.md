# Week 1 - Structure

DOCTYPE specifies the type of this document. It tells the browser how to render this document
A website is a collection of webpages or simply pages
	There are two parts/section that a typical website has: 
	- head
	- body

the utf-8 is the encoding that specifies that this document is an HTML so browsers will know `<meta charset="utf-8">`

Viewport tells browser to scale to fit small devices like mobile phones
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
title is displayed on the browser tab

In this module we will structure our website:
[] stylesheets files will be placed inside `css` folder
